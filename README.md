# SPY Prediction Model

## About
Created a machine learning model using TensorFlow that predicts the value of SPY with less than 1.05% error on the testing data. It uses the past 100 days of SPY data to predict the next one day of data by using Keras' LSTM layers.

## Installation:
- To run the code, you will need an AlphaVantage API key. You can obtain a free key at https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key.
- To run the code, simply clone the repository and run the `stock_prediction_lstm.ipynb` notebook.

## Technologies:
- Python: Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including data analysis, machine learning, and web development.
- Pandas: Pandas is a Python library that is commonly used for data analysis. It includes features such as data manipulation, reading and writing data from/to various file formats, and performing statistical analysis.
- NumPy: NumPy is a Python library that is commonly used for scientific computing. It includes features such as support for large multidimensional arrays and matrices, linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number generation.
- TensorFlow: TensorFlow is a Python library that is commonly used for machine learning. It includes features such as support for deep learning networks, numerical computation, and data flow programming.
- matplotlib: matplotlib is a Python plotting library that is commonly used for data visualization.
